#' Update NFL Game Data
#'
#' Builds/extends the modeling frame using prepare_weekly()/prepare_games().
#' - Optionally replaces stored years
#' - Includes injuries / coaching / referees
#' - Seeds Week 1 with prior-season finals when requested
#' - Ensures `away.spread_line` is present (aligned with "away-oriented" spread checks)
#'
#' @param years integer vector of seasons to (re)build, e.g. 2015:2024
#' @param replace_existing logical; if TRUE, rebuild exactly `years` from source
#' @param seed_week1 logical; carry prior-season stats into Week 1 lags
#' @param include_injuries logical; join injury impacts
#' @param include_coaching logical; join coach tiers + lagged QB stability
#' @param include_referee logical; keep referee metadata
#' @param return_all logical; if TRUE (default), return full dataset
#'   (stored +/- rebuilt). If FALSE, return only the `years` you asked for.
#' @return data.frame of updated games
#' @import dplyr tidyr purrr
