#' Enhanced Referee Performance Analysis with Bias Detection
#'
#' Comprehensive analysis of NFL referee performance that evaluates officiating
#' quality, bias tendencies, and penalty patterns. Integrates schedule data with
#' play-by-play information to provide detailed referee assessments including
#' home field bias detection and consistency measurements.
#'
#' @param schedule_data Data frame containing NFL schedule information with
#'   referee assignments. Required columns:
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item referee - Name of the head referee for each game
#'     \item season, week - Game timing information  
#'     \item home_team, away_team - Team abbreviations
#'     \item game_id - Unique game identifier
#'   }
#'   Optional columns:
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item game_type - Regular season vs playoff designation
#'   }
#'
#' @param pbp_data Optional data frame containing play-by-play information for
#'   enhanced penalty analysis. When provided, enables detailed penalty pattern
#'   analysis. Expected columns include:
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item season, week, game_id - Game identification
#'     \item penalty - Binary indicator for penalty plays (1 = penalty, 0 = no penalty)
#'     \item penalty_team - Team that committed the penalty
#'     \item penalty_type - Description of penalty type
#'     \item penalty_yards - Yards assessed for the penalty
#'     \item qtr - Quarter of the game
#'     \item game_seconds_remaining - Time remaining in game
#'   }
#'   If NULL, analysis proceeds with basic referee statistics only.
#'
#' @return Data frame containing comprehensive referee analysis with the following columns:
#'   \describe{
#'     \item{referee}{Cleaned referee name (title case, standardized)}
#'     \item{referee_quality}{Composite quality score (0-100) based on experience, 
#'       consistency, bias, and game assignments}
#'     \item{referee_experience}{Experience level: veteran, experienced, developing, new}
#'     \item{games_officiated}{Total number of games officiated in dataset}
#'     \item{seasons_active}{Number of seasons active as NFL referee}
#'     \item{playoff_games}{Number of playoff games officiated}
#'     \item{bias_category}{Home field bias classification: neutral, home_favoring,
#'       away_favoring, slight_bias, unknown}
#'     \item{home_bias_score}{Numerical bias score where positive values indicate
#'       away team favoritism, negative values indicate home team favoritism}
#'     \item{consistency_level}{Penalty calling consistency: very_consistent,
#'       consistent, moderate, inconsistent, unknown}
#'     \item{avg_penalties_per_game}{Average penalties called per game}
#'   }
#'   Additional columns when pbp_data is provided:
#'   \describe{
#'     \item{penalty_consistency}{Standard deviation of penalties per game}
#'     \item{holding_rate, pre_snap_rate, etc.}{Rates for different penalty categories}
#'     \item{crunch_time_rate}{Rate of penalties called in final 5 minutes}
#'   }
#'
#' @details
#' The referee analysis employs several sophisticated methodologies:
#'
#' **Quality Score Calculation** (0-100 scale):
#' \itemize{
#'   \item Experience Score: Up to 25 points based on seasons active (2.5 points per season)
#'   \item Consistency Score: 5-20 points based on penalty calling consistency
#'   \item Bias Score: 5-15 points based on neutrality (higher for neutral referees)
#'   \item Game Count Score: Up to 15 points based on total games officiated
#'   \item Playoff Score: Up to 10 points for playoff game assignments
#'   \item Penalty Rate Score: Up to 15 points for appropriate penalty rates (8-16 per game)
#' }
#'
#' **Bias Detection**: Analyzes the distribution of penalties called on home vs away teams:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item Neutral: Home penalty rate between 47-53% (Â±3% from expected 50%)
#'   \item Home Favoring: Home penalty rate >53% (calls more penalties on away team)
#'   \item Away Favoring: Home penalty rate <47% (calls more penalties on home team)
#'   \item Slight Bias: Moderate deviations from neutral
#' }
#'
#' **Penalty Pattern Analysis** (when pbp_data provided):
#' \itemize{
#'   \item Categorizes penalties into types: holding/blocking, pre-snap, pass interference,
#'     personal fouls, procedural violations
#'   \item Analyzes penalty timing: first half vs late game vs crunch time (final 5 minutes)
#'   \item Measures consistency through standard deviation of penalties per game
#' }
#'
#' **Data Quality Handling**:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item Filters referees with <5 games to ensure statistical reliability
#'   \item Standardizes referee names (title case, spacing, common corrections)
#'   \item Provides default values for referees without sufficient penalty data
#'   \item Handles missing play-by-play data gracefully
