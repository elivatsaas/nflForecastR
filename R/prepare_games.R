#' Enhanced Prepare NFL Schedule Data with Internal Weekly Data Generation
#'
#' Comprehensive function that prepares NFL game data by combining schedule information
#' with lagged weekly performance statistics, coaching analysis, injury impacts, and
#' referee tendencies. Handles missing data gracefully and provides multiple strategies
#' for dealing with incomplete information.
#'
#' @param years Vector of integers specifying the NFL seasons to include in the final dataset.
#'   Must be valid NFL seasons (typically 1999 onwards for complete data).
#' @param include_injuries Logical indicating whether to include injury impact analysis.
#'   Requires injury data to be available. Default is TRUE.
#' @param include_coaching Logical indicating whether to include enhanced coaching analysis
#'   with performance tiers and matchup advantages. Default is TRUE.
#' @param include_referee Logical indicating whether to include referee analysis with
#'   bias detection and quality scores. Default is TRUE.
#' @param seed_week1 Logical indicating whether to carry forward prior season's final
#'   statistics into Week 1 for lagged features. Helps with cold-start problem for
#'   season openers. Default is TRUE.
#' @param injury_missing_strategy Character string specifying how to handle missing
#'   injury data. Options are:
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item "zero" - Use zeros as default values for missing injury impacts
#'     \item "weight" - Use 3-week performance weighting to estimate injury impacts
#'   }
#'   Default is "zero".
#'
#' @return A data.frame containing NFL games with the following key components:
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item Schedule information (game_id, season, week, teams, scores, betting lines)
#'     \item Home and away lagged performance statistics (prefixed with "home." and "away.")
#'     \item Coaching analysis (coaching_advantage, coach tiers, experience levels)
#'     \item Injury impacts (total, positional, and advantage calculations)
#'     \item Referee analysis (quality scores, bias categories, penalty tendencies)
#'     \item Derived features (point_differential, rest_advantage, etc.)
#'   }
#'
#' @details
#' This function performs several key operations:
#' \enumerate{
#'   \item Loads and cleans schedule data with specific fixes for known missing values
#'   \item Prepares weekly team performance statistics with proper lagging
#'   \item Handles postponed games (like 2017 TB vs MIA) for proper Week 1 seeding
#'   \item Integrates coaching performance analysis with tier classifications
#'   \item Adds injury impact analysis with multiple missing data strategies
#'   \item Incorporates referee analysis with bias detection
#'   \item Creates derived features and advantage calculations
#' }
#'
#' The function includes specific fixes for known data quality issues:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item 2021 Week 15 NE@IND missing referee (sets to Carl Cheffers)
#'   \item 2017 Week 4 CHI@GB missing betting odds (calculated from spread)
#'   \item Coaches with insufficient games for analysis (provides defaults)
#'   \item Missing referee data (provides neutral defaults)
