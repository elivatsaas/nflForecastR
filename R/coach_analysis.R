#' Analyze Coaching Performance and Create Tiers
#'
#' Comprehensive analysis of NFL head coach performance that creates coaching tiers,
#' analyzes matchup advantages, and tracks special situation performance. Only
#' includes coaches with sufficient game sample sizes (16+ games) for reliable
#' statistical analysis.

#' @details
#' The coaching analysis employs several key methodologies:
#'
#' **Performance Tiers**: Coaches are classified into six tiers based on win percentage:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item Elite (â‰¥65.0%) - Historically great coaches
#'   \item Very Good (58.0-64.9%) - Consistently strong coaches  
#'   \item Good (52.0-57.9%) - Above average coaches
#'   \item Average (45.0-51.9%) - League average coaches
#'   \item Below Average (40.0-44.9%) - Struggling coaches
#'   \item Poor (<40.0%) - Coaches with significant difficulties
#' }
#'
#' **Coaching Score**: Composite 0-100 metric incorporating:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item Win percentage (60% weight)
#'   \item Recent performance - last 3 seasons (25% weight)
#'   \item Experience bonus (coaching years * 0.8)
#'   \item Stability bonus (5 points for stable tenure)
#'   \item Loyalty bonus (5 points for single-team coaches)
#' }
#'
#' **Experience Levels**: Based on seasons as head coach:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item Veteran (15+ seasons)
#'   \item Experienced (8-14 seasons)
#'   \item Developing (4-7 seasons)
#'   \item Emerging (2-3 seasons)
#'   \item Rookie (1 season)
#' }
#'
#' **Sample Size Filter**: Only coaches with 16+ games are included to ensure
#' statistical reliability and exclude interim/emergency coaches.
