\details{
The coaching analysis employs several key methodologies:

\strong{Performance Tiers}: Coaches are classified into six tiers based on win percentage:
\itemize{
\item Elite (â‰¥65.0\%) - Historically great coaches
\item Very Good (58.0-64.9\%) - Consistently strong coaches
\item Good (52.0-57.9\%) - Above average coaches
\item Average (45.0-51.9\%) - League average coaches
\item Below Average (40.0-44.9\%) - Struggling coaches
\item Poor (<40.0\%) - Coaches with significant difficulties
}

\strong{Coaching Score}: Composite 0-100 metric incorporating:
\itemize{
\item Win percentage (60\% weight)
\item Recent performance - last 3 seasons (25\% weight)
\item Experience bonus (coaching years * 0.8)
\item Stability bonus (5 points for stable tenure)
\item Loyalty bonus (5 points for single-team coaches)
}

\strong{Experience Levels}: Based on seasons as head coach:
\itemize{
\item Veteran (15+ seasons)
\item Experienced (8-14 seasons)
\item Developing (4-7 seasons)
\item Emerging (2-3 seasons)
\item Rookie (1 season)
}

\strong{Sample Size Filter}: Only coaches with 16+ games are included to ensure
statistical reliability and exclude interim/emergency coaches.
