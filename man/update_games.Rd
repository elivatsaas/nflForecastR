\item{seed_week1}{logical; carry prior-season stats into Week 1 lags}

\item{include_injuries}{logical; join injury impacts}

\item{include_coaching}{logical; join coach tiers + lagged QB stability}

\item{return_all}{logical; if TRUE (default), return full dataset
(stored +/- rebuilt). If FALSE, return only the \code{years} you asked for.}

\description{
Builds/extends the modeling frame using prepare_weekly()/prepare_games().
\itemize{
